\subsection*{A\+V\+L\+Tree \href{https://travis-ci.org/ob-algdati-ws17/blatt-7-aufgabe-1-p-p}{\tt }}

Implementation of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree}{\tt A\+VL Tree}. This is a self-\/balancing tree with fast search, insert and delete complexities of O(log(n)). In our implementation we don\textquotesingle{}t save the \textquotesingle{}parent\textquotesingle{} of a node in the node but retrieve the parent by traversing the tree. This saves us the O(n) space-\/complexity in favour of the O(log n) time-\/complexity.
